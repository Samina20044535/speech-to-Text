Overview

This project provides a comprehensive speech-to-text solution. It is structured into the following key components:

Frontend: Handles the user interface.

Backend: Manages application logic and API endpoints.

Database: Stores and manages application data.

Docker Compose: Facilitates containerized deployment of the application.

Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following tools are installed:

Docker

Docker Compose

Git

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url>
cd speech_to_text_project

2. Configure Environment Variables

Check for .env files in the frontend, backend, and database directories.

Update the values as needed (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

3. Build and Start Services

Use Docker Compose to build and start all services:

docker-compose up --build

This will set up the frontend, backend, and database services in their respective containers.

Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker Compose on any server that meets the prerequisites. Follow these steps:

Copy the project files to your server.

Run docker-compose up --build as described above.

Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik to expose the frontend to the internet, if needed.

Inter-Service Communication

Overview

Services communicate via internal Docker networking. The docker-compose.yml file configures networks and maps appropriate ports.

Components Communication

Frontend

Communicates with the backend using HTTP.

Ensure the backend API URL is set in the frontend's configuration (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL).

Backend

Interfaces with the database using a database driver (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).

Handles client requests via RESTful API endpoints.

Database

Accessible only by the backend.

Connection settings (host, port, username, password) are defined in the backend environment variables.

Troubleshooting

Service Fails to Start: Check logs for errors using:

docker-compose logs <service_name>

Database Connectivity Issues: Ensure credentials in the backend's environment variables match the database configuration.

Frontend Not Loading: Verify the API URL in the frontend configuration points to the correct backend service.

Additional Notes

Modify the docker-compose.yml file to add or remove services as needed.

For production use, consider configuring SSL and other security measures.

Consult individual component documentation in the respective directories for more details.
